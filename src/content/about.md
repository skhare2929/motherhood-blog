## My Story

Hello! I'm Suraksha, an Engineer by degree and currently a full time mom, sharing my journey through the beautiful chaos of parenthood. From sleepless nights to heartwarming milestones, I'm documenting it all here. I believe in honest conversations about motherhood—the good, the challenging, and everything in between.

Before becoming a mother, I never imagined how transformative this journey would be, and how it will change the Me in me. This blog is my way of processing the experience, connecting with other parents, and creating a space where we can all feel a little less alone in this adventure.

## Why I Started This Blog

I started this blog because I wanted to share the real side of motherhood. Not the perfectly filtered Instagram version, but the messy, beautiful, exhausting, joyful reality. When I was a new mom, I felt so isolated and wondered if everyone else had it more together than I did. Spoiler alert: they didn't!

My hope is that by sharing my experiences—both the wins and the struggles—other parents will feel less alone. Whether you're dealing with sleep regression, figuring out feeding, or just trying to survive the toddler years, I want you to know: you're doing great, and it's okay to not have all the answers.

## What You'll Find Here

On this blog, I share:

- **Personal experiences** from my motherhood journey
- **Real talk** about the challenges we don't always discuss
- **What's worked for us** (and what hasn't!)
- **Resources and tips** I've found helpful along the way
- **A supportive community** where all parents are welcome

## My Approach

I want to be clear: **I am not a medical professional, child development expert, or certified anything.** I'm just a mom sharing what I've learned through experience, research, and (let's be honest) a lot of trial and error.

Everything I share here is my personal experience and perspective. What worked for my family might not work for yours, and that's completely normal. Every child is different, every family is different, and there's no one "right" way to parent.

If you ever have concerns about your child's health, development, or well-being, please consult with qualified healthcare professionals. They have the training and expertise to provide proper guidance for your specific situation.

## Let's Connect!

I'd love to hear from you! Whether you want to share your own experiences, ask questions, or just say hello, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're all in this together, and I truly believe that supporting one another makes the journey so much better.

Thank you for being here and for being part of this community. Here's to embracing the beautiful mess of motherhood, one day at a time!
