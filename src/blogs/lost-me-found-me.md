**Wow!!!**

When I thought of writing about my journey, these words echoed in my mind, like giving me some direction or nudging me towards something... I think this was it—a journey, a sense of belonging.

These are not just words for me; they represent my persona. The meaning is simple: Through my years of parenting, I felt like I literally lost myself, faded somewhere—around many people but still isolated. Yup!!! Felt it all. You name it, I have felt it. But for the past year, I found a new me: renewed, invigorated.



## A Little Background First

I've been mom of a cute little baby boy, since 2021, and we are a little family of three: me, my husband, and our little one. Our son just turned four, and we are still in those blissful toddler years where every day comes with something new.

Although it's just been four years, it feels like we've done a lot of parenting. How are we going to get through the years yet to come, thats the question?

I am sure I am not the only one who felt lost, scared, alone, anxious, or sometimes a knot of emotions which is hard to explain. I remember the feeding times with my kiddo, sitting for hours, looking at him, blessing him, crying, tempting of being out there with others but couldn't. 

It made me wonder, it takes a lot to be a mother, the sea of emotions which flows all the time with no control whatsoever, silent thoughts, and one day when you pull out of it a little bit, thats when it happens; i found myself a little. Its still a long journey, and we are taking baby steps in it... Together!!!
