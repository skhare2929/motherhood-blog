Let's talk about one of the hardest part of being a mother. Yes! the least understood, least talked about and most overwhelming state of a new mom - Isolation. Nobody really understands it until it has been felt by themselves; even sometimes new moms find it hard to explain, so they try to keep it to themselves.

A new mom, sitting on a rocking chair, or on a bed, with a nursing pillow placed around her body, feeding the baby for hours - sounds familiar right! I know you all must have felt it — the quiet, no matter if it's daytime or night, the state remains the same. In that moment, it feels like the whole world is still turning — people going about their daily routines, chatting with friends, running errands, sitting in cafés with coffee in hand. Life is moving, conversations are happening, days are unfolding.

And here I am, sitting still, nursing my tiny human — feeling both deeply connected and somehow apart from it all.


It might sound insensitive at first but it truly isn't. When you become a mother, you pour your whole being into that tiny little human — your mind, your body, your soul, even your sanity... everything, because that's how you feel when you look into those sparkly, beautiful, curious eyes, you see your whole world reflected back at you. 
But before she was a mom, she was a person. We miss those talks, the everyday routine, the rush we sometimes complained about... we miss it all. And its okay to miss the part of you that once defined you - your individual identity that belonged to you.

Deep down we know that the new life will find its balance, it might be different than before, it might not have those quiet hours that belonged only to you, but a new beautiful normal. A life filled with love, cuddles, giggles, spit-ups, milestones and a house full of chaos.

Still, in those long, quiet moments of sitting and nursing, time stands still, and the life existed before feels like a lifetime away.

## My Breastfeeding Journey

I remember my days of breastfeeding. I exclusively breastfed my little one for two and a half years. I did not rush into anything; the weaning happened on its own. He started showing less interest and wanted to try other food more often. Once a day, we used to give him regular milk which he liked and within a week if I remember correctly, he weaned off completely.

It feels a lot easier to write about it now, but boy, what a journey it was — and trust me, I remember each and every moment of sitting on my bed, nursing... just nursing.

Luckily, I had good milk production and never had to get any additional help and my baby was able to feed well, but he fed for hours. I am sure many of you also had the same experience when the baby just doesn't want to leave your breast. It feels like your entire life had been curled up into that spot, switching sides, and you think of everything in those countless hours, and still get the feeling of numbness; like your thoughts have drifted away and are still there simultaneously. You try to stay connected to the reality and at some point, shopping and social media become your buddy, as they are there at your disposal irrespective of the hour.

## The Contradictions

While sitting alone in those hours sometimes I felt the desperation to talk to someone, and literally seconds later I felt like being left alone and not wanting to utter a word. And I know when I say this to someone they might think I am not in the right state — but the truth is, that's what it does to a new mother. We feel blessed to be able to do this but at the same time crave for some normalcy, and maybe moments later we are just crying and literally have no answer if someone asks why.
We do feel the urge to tell them how we are feeling at that moment, but at the same time don't have the strength to utter more than two sentences.

## You Are Not Alone

I do feel in those moment of early motherhood what we most crave isn't help or advice - it's simply company.
Many of us have partners, family, and loved ones around after delivery. Yet in those first days at home with a newborn, everyone is caught up in something — caring for the baby, managing the house, balancing work, tending to endless tasks. In the middle of all that movement and responsibility, a mother’s emotional state can quietly fade into the background. Not because no one cares, but because everything feels urgent.
If you are in that space right now, longing for someone to simply sit with you, please know this: you are not alone. Your need for companionship is valid. It is okay to ask someone to stay, to talk, or even to share a few silent moments by your side.
You deserve care, too.
