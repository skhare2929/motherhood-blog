We're approaching my baby's first birthday, and I'm a mess of emotions. How did we go from a tiny, helpless newborn to this curious, mobile, babbling little person in just 12 months?

Everyone told me it would go fast. I didn't believe them during those endless 3 AM wake-ups. But here we are, and they were right.

Let me take you through our first year—the milestones, the challenges, and the unexpected moments that made it all worthwhile.

## Month 1: Survival Mode

**The milestone:** Just surviving, honestly.

Those first weeks were a blur of feeding every 2-3 hours, learning to change diapers, and trying to understand different cries. I remember thinking, "People do this on purpose? Multiple times?!"

**The unexpected joy:** The first time he fell asleep on my chest and I just watched him breathe. Pure magic.

**What I wish I'd known:** It's okay to just survive this month. You don't need to do tummy time perfectly or follow wake windows. Just keep everyone alive and fed.

## Month 2: The First Smile

**The milestone:** Social smiling started around 6 weeks.

After weeks of it feeling like one-way caregiving, that first real smile made everything worth it. He was actually responding to us!

**The challenge:** The 6-week growth spurt hit like a truck. Cluster feeding and constant nursing made me feel like a human milk machine.

**What helped:** Reminding myself it was temporary. Growth spurts pass. (And they do!)

## Month 3: Finding Our Rhythm

**The milestone:** Discovered his hands and started batting at toys.

We started to feel like we knew what we were doing (narrator: they didn't). But seriously, we had a bit of a routine, and that made life feel more manageable.

**The unexpected:** My hair started falling out in clumps. Postpartum hair loss is NO JOKE.

**The joy:** His first laugh. I'd make ridiculous faces and sounds for hours just to hear that giggle.

## Month 4: Sleep Regression Strikes

**The milestone:** Rolling from tummy to back!

**The challenge:** The 4-month sleep regression destroyed us. We went from sleeping 5-hour stretches back to waking every 2 hours.

**What got us through:** Tag-teaming with my partner, lots of coffee, and the knowledge that this too shall pass.

**Pro tip:** The 4-month regression often isn't a regression—it's a permanent change in sleep patterns. This is when we started thinking about sleep training.

## Month 5: Sitting (with Support)

**The milestone:** Could sit supported and was getting stronger every day.

This was when play got more fun! He could sit in his high chair, interact with toys more intentionally, and we started thinking about introducing solids.

**The surprise:** He found his feet and became obsessed with them. Toes went in the mouth constantly. So gross. So cute.

## Month 6: Solid Foods Adventure Begins

**The milestone:** Started solids! (See my blog post about baby-led weaning for the full story.)

**The joy:** Watching him experience new flavors and textures. The faces he made trying lemon, pickles, and avocado were priceless.

**The reality:** SO. MUCH. MESS. Our dog had never been happier, though.

**Also at 6 months:** Sitting unassisted! This changed everything. He could play independently, and I could actually sit and drink my coffee (lukewarm, but still).

## Month 7: Mobility Incoming

**The milestone:** Started army crawling and getting up on hands and knees.

**What this meant:** Time to babyproof EVERYTHING. Outlet covers, cabinet locks, gates—our house looked like Fort Knox.

**The challenge:** He wanted to move but couldn't quite crawl yet. Cue lots of frustration (for him and us).

**The cute:** Started understanding peek-a-boo and thought it was the funniest thing in the world.

## Month 8: On the Move

**The milestone:** Full-on crawling! And pulling to stand!

**The reality:** I became a full-time spotter. He'd pull himself up on furniture but had no idea how to get down safely.

**The injury:** First real bump on the head. I cried more than he did.

**What I learned:** Bumps and falls are part of learning. Kids are resilient. (Though I still felt terrible.)

## Month 9: Little Communicator

**The milestone:** Started waving, clapping, and pointing!

This was the month he really became interactive. He'd point at things he wanted, wave bye-bye, and clap when excited.

**The words:** First word attempts! "Mama," "Dada," and something that sounded like "dog."

**The challenge:** Separation anxiety hit HARD. I couldn't leave the room without tears.

## Month 10: Cruising Along

**The milestone:** Cruising along furniture like a pro.

He'd walk while holding onto the couch, coffee table, or our legs. Walking was clearly coming soon.

**The development:** Understanding simple words and commands. "Where's the ball?" and he'd look for it!

**The hard part:** Still not sleeping through the night. I was exhausted and wondering if we'd ever get full nights of sleep again.

## Month 11: Almost Walking

**The milestone:** Standing unassisted for a few seconds! Taking 1-2 independent steps before falling!

**The personality:** Oh my goodness, the personality exploded this month. Sense of humor, preferences, opinions—he was his own little person.

**The feeding:** Transitioning to mostly table foods. He'd eat almost anything we ate (except green beans—those were the enemy).

## Month 12: The Birthday Month

**The milestone:** WALKING! He took his first independent steps a week before his birthday.

**The reflection:** I can't believe we've made it a full year. We survived the newborn phase, sleep regressions, teething, illnesses, developmental leaps, and countless diaper changes.

**The emotion:** I'm simultaneously celebrating how far we've come and grieving the tiny newborn he used to be.

## What Nobody Tells You About Milestones

### 1. **They're ranges, not deadlines**

My baby didn't roll at 4 months like the app said he should. He rolled at 3.5 months. Then he stopped rolling for weeks. Then started again. Development isn't linear.

### 2. **Comparison is the thief of joy**

My friend's baby was walking at 10 months. Mine just started at 12 months. Both are completely normal. Both babies are thriving.

### 3. **Milestones often cause sleep disruptions**

Every time he was learning something new—rolling, crawling, standing—sleep went to hell. It's normal. Their brains are working overtime.

### 4. **They might skip milestones**

Some babies never crawl—they go straight to walking. Some don't babble much before talking. Every baby is different.

### 5. **The apps can make you crazy**

I had to delete the milestone tracking apps. They were making me anxious instead of informed.

## The Milestones That Aren't in the Books

Beyond the "official" milestones, there were so many moments that mattered:

- The first time he reached for me instead of dad
- When he started giving open-mouth "kisses"
- The first time he fell asleep without being rocked or nursed
- When he started showing empathy (patting my face when I was upset)
- The first time he made us laugh intentionally
- When I realized I wasn't constantly anxious anymore

These moments aren't tracked in apps, but they're the ones that stick with you.

## What This Year Taught Me

**1. Trust your instincts:** You know your baby better than any app or book.

**2. Every baby is different:** Developmental windows are WIDE for a reason.

**3. The hard phases pass:** Every single phase that felt eternal eventually ended.

**4. Celebrate the small wins:** Every new skill is worth celebrating, whether it's "on time" or not.

**5. Document the memories:** I'm so glad I took videos and photos, even when I looked terrible.

**6. You're doing better than you think:** Seriously. Give yourself credit.

## Looking Ahead to Year Two

I have no idea what this next year holds. More milestones, more challenges, more growth (for both of us).

But if year one taught me anything, it's that we'll figure it out as we go. Just like we've done so far.

## To Other First-Year Parents

If you're in the thick of the first year right now:

- **The days are long, but the year is short.** Everyone says it, and it's annoyingly true.
- **You're doing a great job**, even when it doesn't feel like it.
- **Those milestones will happen** when your baby is ready.
- **Take the photos and videos.** You'll want to remember this.
- **Be present.** The dishes can wait. This time is fleeting.

Happy almost-birthday to my little one. This year has been the hardest, most beautiful, most transformative year of my life.

Here's to year two.
