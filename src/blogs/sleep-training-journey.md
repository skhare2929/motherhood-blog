After months of sleepless nights and countless wake-ups, we finally decided to try sleep training. I'll be honest—I was terrified. Would my baby cry for hours? Would I be able to stick to it? Would it damage our bond? These questions kept me up at night (ironically, when I should have been sleeping!).

## Our Sleep Situation Before Training

At 6 months old, our little one was waking up 5-7 times per night. Every. Single. Night. I was running on fumes, my partner was exhausted, and we knew something had to change. Our baby wasn't getting quality sleep either—he'd wake up cranky and overtired.

We were doing all the "wrong" things according to the internet: rocking to sleep, nursing to sleep, co-sleeping when desperate. But honestly? We were just surviving.

## Choosing Our Method

I spent weeks researching different sleep training methods:

- **Cry It Out (CIO/Extinction)**: Put baby down and don't go back until morning
- **Ferber Method (Graduated Extinction)**: Check on baby at increasing intervals
- **Chair Method**: Gradually move further from the crib each night
- **Pick Up/Put Down**: Pick up when crying, put down when calm

We chose a modified Ferber approach because it felt like a middle ground. We could still check on our baby, but we'd give him space to learn to self-soothe.

## Night One: The Hardest Night

I'm not going to sugarcoat it—the first night was rough. Really rough. Our baby cried for 43 minutes (yes, I was watching the clock). We did check-ins at 3, 5, and 10-minute intervals.

What helped us stick with it:
- My partner and I took turns doing check-ins so neither of us got too overwhelmed
- We used a baby monitor so we could see he was safe
- We reminded ourselves that he was fed, clean, and comfortable—he was just learning a new skill

## The Progress

**Night 2**: 25 minutes of crying
**Night 3**: 15 minutes
**Night 4**: 8 minutes
**Night 5**: 2 minutes of fussing, then sleep

By the end of week one, our baby was falling asleep independently within 5 minutes. The night wakings didn't disappear immediately, but they decreased from 5-7 to 1-2.

## What Surprised Me

1. **It worked faster than expected**: I thought we'd need weeks, but we saw major improvements in days
2. **My baby wasn't traumatized**: He still smiled at us in the morning, still wanted cuddles, still loved us
3. **Everyone was happier**: A well-rested baby is a happier baby. A well-rested mama is a happier mama
4. **Naps improved too**: Once he learned to fall asleep at night, naps became easier

## What Made It Successful

- **Consistent bedtime routine**: Bath, pajamas, book, song, bed—same order every night
- **Earlier bedtime**: We moved bedtime from 8:30 to 7:00 PM (overtiredness was making everything worse!)
- **Dark room**: Blackout curtains were a game-changer
- **White noise**: Helped mask household sounds
- **Both parents on board**: We supported each other through the tough moments

## What I Wish I'd Known

- **It's not all-or-nothing**: We still do one night feed because our pediatrician said it's fine
- **Regression happens**: We've had a few rough nights since, but we stay consistent and things improve
- **Trust your instincts**: If something feels wrong, pause and reassess
- **Every baby is different**: Our friend tried the same method and it took 3 weeks—that's okay too!

## Is Sleep Training Right for Everyone?

Absolutely not, and that's completely fine! Some families:
- Choose to bedshare safely
- Continue with gentle methods
- Wait until baby is older
- Do a combination approach

**There is no one "right" way to handle baby sleep.** You know your baby best, and you know what your family can handle.

## Our Experience Three Months Later

Our baby now sleeps 11-12 hours at night with usually just one wake-up for a quick feed. Bedtime is peaceful—we do our routine, put him in his crib awake, and he falls asleep on his own.

Is it perfect every night? No. Does he still have rough nights when he's teething or sick? Absolutely. But we have tools now, and we know he can sleep.

## Bottom Line

Sleep training was one of the hardest but most rewarding things we've done as parents. It wasn't just about getting more sleep (though that was amazing)—it was about teaching our baby a crucial life skill.

If you're considering sleep training:
1. Talk to your pediatrician first
2. Choose a method that feels right for your family
3. Make sure both caregivers are on the same page
4. Be consistent
5. Trust the process (and your baby!)

Remember: **You're not a bad parent for sleep training, and you're not a bad parent for NOT sleep training.** You're doing what's best for YOUR family, and that's what matters.
