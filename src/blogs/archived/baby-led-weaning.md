When it came time to introduce solids, I found myself overwhelmed by all the different approaches. Purees? Baby-led weaning? A combination? After doing research and talking to our pediatrician, we decided to try baby-led weaning, and it's been such an adventure!

## What is Baby-Led Weaning?

Baby-led weaning (BLW) means skipping purees and letting baby feed themselves from the start. You offer soft, appropriately-sized pieces of food, and baby explores at their own pace.

Key principles:
- Baby feeds themselves from the beginning
- Family eats together
- Baby is exposed to a variety of foods and textures
- Focus is on exploration, not consumption

## Why We Chose BLW

Honestly? A few reasons:

1. **Less work**: No pureeing, no airplane noises, no forcing spoonfuls
2. **Family meals**: We could all eat together (mostly) the same food
3. **Motor skill development**: Babies learn hand-eye coordination and fine motor skills
4. **Less picky eating**: (Hopefully!) Early exposure to variety might mean less pickiness later
5. **It looked fun**: Watching babies explore food just seemed joyful

## Our First Foods

We started at 6 months when our baby could:
- Sit up unassisted
- Show interest in our food
- Bring objects to his mouth
- Had lost the tongue-thrust reflex

**First foods we offered:**
- Steamed sweet potato wedges
- Avocado slices (rolled in baby cereal for grip)
- Banana spears
- Steamed broccoli florets
- Roasted carrot sticks
- Strips of toast with mashed avocado

## The Reality: It's MESSY

Oh my goodness, the mess. THE MESS.

I thought I was prepared. I was not prepared.

We now have:
- A splat mat under the high chair
- Bibs with pockets (multiple—one is always in the wash)
- A dog who's become very food-motivated
- Walls that need daily wiping
- Food in places I didn't know existed

But you know what? It's worth it. The mess is temporary, and we can always clean it up.

## The Gagging vs. Choking Learning Curve

This was my biggest fear. I took an infant CPR class before starting (highly recommend!), and I learned the crucial difference:

**Gagging:**
- Normal part of learning to eat
- Baby makes noise, coughs, might go red
- Baby handles it themselves
- Happens when food goes too far back

**Choking:**
- Silent—this is the scary part
- Baby can't cough or make noise
- Needs immediate intervention
- Food is blocking the airway

Our baby gagged a lot in the first few weeks. It was terrifying at first, but I learned to stay calm, watch, and let him work it out. He always did.

## What Worked for Us

**Food preparation:**
- Made foods the size of an adult finger
- Soft enough to squish between thumb and finger
- Offered one food with a strong flavor and one milder option
- Loaded foods with healthy fats (avocado, olive oil, nut butter)

**Mealtime structure:**
- Started with one meal per day, gradually increased
- Offered food when baby was happy, not overtired or starving
- Ate with him as much as possible
- Kept meals to about 20-30 minutes

**Safety:**
- Always supervised 100%
- Kept baby upright in high chair
- No distractions during meals (no TV, toys, etc.)
- Avoided high-risk choking foods (whole grapes, nuts, popcorn, etc.)

## Surprising Discoveries

1. **Babies have preferences from day one**: Loved sweet potato, suspicious of green beans
2. **Skills develop fast**: Within weeks, he went from fist-grabbing to pincer grip
3. **Milk is still the main nutrition**: For the first year, food is for fun and practice
4. **Not every meal is successful**: Some days he'd eat tons, other days he'd just throw everything on the floor
5. **It's about exposure**: We offered foods 10-15 times before deciding he didn't like something

## Common Questions I Had

**"But isn't my baby too young for seasoning?"**
We use herbs and mild spices! Just avoid salt and sugar. Our baby has tried garlic, cumin, cinnamon, basil—he loves flavor!

**"What about iron?"**
We focused on iron-rich foods: meat, beans, lentils, tofu, iron-fortified cereals. Our pediatrician checked his levels and gave us the thumbs up.

**"Isn't it wasteful?"**
Honestly, yes, a lot of food ends up on the floor. But I remind myself it's not wasted—it's education! We're teaching a crucial life skill.

**"What about allergies?"**
We introduced top allergens early (peanut butter, eggs, dairy, etc.) after talking with our pediatrician. Current research suggests early introduction may reduce allergy risk!

## Three Months In: Where We Are Now

Our 9-month-old can:
- Pick up tiny pieces of food with his pincer grasp
- Take appropriate-sized bites (most of the time)
- Drink from an open cup with help
- Feed himself an entire meal

He eats a huge variety of foods:
- Vegetables: broccoli, carrots, peppers, cucumber, tomatoes
- Fruits: berries, melon, banana, mango, pears
- Proteins: chicken, salmon, eggs, beans, lentils, tofu
- Grains: pasta, rice, bread, oatmeal, quinoa
- Dairy: cheese, yogurt

## The Combo Approach

Plot twist: We don't do 100% BLW. Sometimes we:
- Spoon-feed yogurt or oatmeal (baby holds the spoon too)
- Offer pouches when we're out
- Use purees for foods that are hard to make finger-friendly

**And that's totally okay!** You don't have to be a purist. Do what works for your family.

## Is BLW Right for You?

BLW might work well if you:
- Are comfortable with mess
- Can supervise every meal completely
- Want to eat together as a family
- Like the idea of baby self-feeding
- Have a baby who's developmentally ready

It might not work if:
- You're very anxious about gagging/choking
- You don't have time to prepare finger foods
- Your childcare provider isn't on board
- Your baby has certain developmental delays (talk to your pediatrician!)

## My Biggest Tips

1. **Take an infant CPR class**: Peace of mind is priceless
2. **Start simple**: You don't need fancy recipes, just safe foods
3. **Let go of perfection**: They won't starve, and mess is temporary
4. **Trust your baby**: They know when they're full
5. **Make it social**: Eat together, model eating, make it fun!

## Final Thoughts

Baby-led weaning has been messy, sometimes stressful, but ultimately joyful. Watching our baby explore foods, make funny faces at new flavors, and proudly feed himself has been one of the highlights of this first year.

Whether you choose purees, BLW, or a combination—you're doing great. Fed is best, and every family's journey is different!
