I remember, when we first got the two double solid lines - our world changed for real... in a happy way of course. We started preparing for everything: financial aspects, our home, how to manage home and work, researching everything, educating ourselves etc. We were really confident and felt prepared, since it was me and my husband who were taking care of every little thing since the pregnancy started.

Things hit hard when we arrived home for the first time with our baby. At the hospital, the mother-and-baby care team had been guiding us in many ways — taking care of so much while also patiently teaching us how to handle a newborn. But once we were home, it was just us. As first parents everything was new to us and we were being careful, protective, and may be a little paranoid...but in the most loving and caring way. It was overwhelming and beautiful all at once.

At home, there was a moment when we were alone with the baby for the first time, and were like, now what...? what to do next...? That's when all the preparation came into picture... and we were not prepared for that. Theory was fine, reading was fine, thinking of handling the situation and actually handling the situation are two very different things... And WE KNOW THAT NOW...



## The Overwhelming Joy

As new parents, there is always a lingering question- are we doing it right? Everything is new to us just as its new to the baby. We both are learning, nobody is prepared for going without any sleep for a whole night, or don't really understand what sleep deprivation is? until one night you felt it for real. Parenting is not always magical, its practical, its chaos, its struggle, its emotional roller coaster, its difficult. But it sure comes with its own joy. When you sit in the room, baby sleeping in the crib and there is silence-  just looking at your creation and thinking about that long journey of nine months, that's when you actually feel- the overwhelming joy.
