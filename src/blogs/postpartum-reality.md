Nobody really prepares you for postpartum. Sure, people mention that you'll be tired and that recovery takes time, but the reality is so much more complex than that. The physical changes, the emotional rollercoaster, the identity shift—it's all so overwhelming, and yet we're expected to just "bounce back" and know exactly what to do with this tiny human.

Let's talk about the things I wish someone had told me before I entered the postpartum period.

## The Physical Recovery is No Joke

I thought once the baby was out, my body would start feeling normal again. Wrong.

**What I experienced:**
- Afterpains that felt like labor contractions (especially while nursing!)
- Bleeding for 6 weeks straight
- Night sweats that soaked through the sheets
- Hair falling out in clumps at 3 months postpartum
- A postpartum belly that looked 6 months pregnant
- Incontinence when I sneezed or laughed
- Pain and soreness in places I didn't know existed

**What helped:**
- Padsicles (frozen pads with witch hazel—life-changing!)
- Peri bottle for bathroom trips
- High-waisted underwear (the granny panties are worth it)
- Pelvic floor physical therapy at 8 weeks postpartum
- Giving myself grace and patience
- Actually resting during those first two weeks

## The Emotional Tsunami

I've always been a pretty stable person emotionally. Postpartum hormones? They knocked me flat.

**The baby blues** (weeks 1-2):
- Crying at absolutely everything
- Feeling overwhelmed and anxious
- Mood swings that came out of nowhere
- Wondering if I'd made a huge mistake

**This is normal.** Your hormones are literally plummeting. I cried watching a diaper commercial. I sobbed when my partner ate the last cookie. It's temporary, and it's okay.

**When to worry:**
If feelings intensify after two weeks or include thoughts of harming yourself or baby, please reach out to your doctor immediately. Postpartum depression and postpartum anxiety are real, common, and treatable.

I dealt with postpartum anxiety (more on that in a future post), and getting help was the best decision I made.

## The Identity Crisis Nobody Talks About

I love my baby more than anything. And also? I grieved my old life.

This is the contradiction nobody prepares you for: you can be overwhelmed with love for your baby while simultaneously mourning the person you used to be.

**Things I grieved:**
- Spontaneity (can't just leave the house anymore!)
- Sleep (obviously)
- My body and how it used to look and feel
- Date nights with my partner
- Quiet mornings with coffee and a book
- My career identity and being "just me"
- Having time for hobbies

**Here's what I learned:** It's okay to grieve these things. It doesn't mean you don't love your baby. It means you're human, and you're adjusting to a massive life change.

## The Relationship Shifts

### With Your Partner

I was not prepared for how much our relationship would change. We went from being lovers and best friends to co-workers managing feeding schedules and diaper changes.

**Common struggles:**
- Resentment (especially if you're breastfeeding and they get to sleep!)
- Feeling like roommates instead of partners
- Different parenting opinions causing friction
- No time or energy for intimacy
- Keeping score of who did more

**What helped us:**
- Communicating even when we were exhausted
- Having "appreciation check-ins" where we thanked each other
- Tag-teaming so each person got breaks
- Remembering we're on the same team
- Being patient with each other (and ourselves)
- Scheduling couple time, even if it's just 15 minutes

### With Your Own Mother

Becoming a mother changed my relationship with my mom. I suddenly understood her in ways I never had before. But also? We had disagreements about parenting choices that created tension.

Setting boundaries was hard but necessary. Yes, even with family.

### With Friends

Some friendships deepened. Some drifted. Friends without kids didn't always understand why I couldn't just "get a babysitter." Friends with kids became my lifeline.

It's okay if your friend circle changes during this season.

## Things I Wish I'd Known

### 1. **You don't have to love every moment**

The "treasure every moment" advice? It's garbage. Some moments are terrible. You're allowed to hate the 3 AM wake-ups and still love your baby.

### 2. **Breastfeeding might not be magical**

I thought it would be this beautiful, natural bonding experience. Instead? It was painful, stressful, and anxiety-inducing for weeks. Some people love it, some don't. Both are valid.

### 3. **The "fourth trimester" is real**

Babies are basically born three months too early. They need the womb-like environment: darkness, shushing, swaddling, rocking. That's why newborns are SO needy.

### 4. **You're not failing—this is just hard**

If you're struggling, it's not because you're doing something wrong. It's because caring for a newborn while recovering from childbirth while running on no sleep is OBJECTIVELY DIFFICULT.

### 5. **Asking for help is not weakness**

Let people bring you meals. Let your partner do night duty. Hire a postpartum doula if you can. Join a support group. Talk to a therapist. Accept help.

### 6. **Your body grew a human—give it time**

I was so hard on myself about my postpartum body. But seriously? Your body did something incredible. Those stretch marks? Battle scars. That loose skin? Evidence of the miracle you created.

You don't need to "bounce back." You went through a major medical event. Healing takes time.

### 7. **Babies don't follow the books**

I read ALL the books. My baby didn't care. He didn't sleep through the night at 12 weeks like the book said. He didn't follow the wake windows. He was (and is) his own person.

Trust your instincts over the "experts."

### 8. **It gets easier (and then harder, then easier again)**

Just when you figure out one stage, they enter a new one. But you become a more confident parent with each phase.

## What Helped Me Survive

**Practical things:**
- Meal train from friends
- Paper plates (less dishes = more rest)
- Low expectations for housework
- Online grocery delivery
- Baby wearing (hands-free life!)
- A good binge-worthy show for night feeds

**Mental/emotional things:**
- Postpartum support group
- Therapy (telehealth was perfect)
- Journaling my feelings
- Daily walks outside
- Saying "no" to visitors when I needed to
- Unfollowing "perfect" mom accounts on social media

## For Partners: How to Support

If you're the partner reading this, here's what helped me:

- Take over household tasks without being asked
- Bring snacks and water while she's nursing
- Handle night diaper changes
- Protect her rest time
- Listen without trying to fix everything
- Validate her feelings
- Take the baby for a walk so she can shower/nap
- Don't say "just sleep when the baby sleeps" (she's heard it a million times!)

## The Light at the End of the Tunnel

I'm now 8 months postpartum, and I can tell you: it does get better. Not perfect, but better.

I've learned to:
- Accept my new body
- Set boundaries
- Ask for help
- Find pockets of joy in the chaos
- Be gentle with myself
- Celebrate small wins

## Final Thoughts

Postpartum is a wild ride. It's beautiful and terrible, joyful and lonely, magical and mundane—often all at the same time.

If you're in the thick of it right now, please know:
- **You're not alone** in feeling overwhelmed
- **You're not failing** even when it feels like you are
- **You're doing better than you think**
- **It's okay to not be okay**
- **It will get easier**

And please, if you're struggling with your mental health, reach out to your healthcare provider. Postpartum depression and anxiety are medical conditions that deserve treatment. You deserve support.
